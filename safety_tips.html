            <P>A warranty is usually a written guarantee for a product and declares the maker's responsibility to repair
                or replace a defective product or its parts. A guarantee is an agreement assuming responsibility to
                perform, execute, or complete something and offering security for that agreement. However, companies
                generally offer only warranty for their products.</P>

        <li>
            <p>If a product is under warranty, the company has to honour it as per the terms of the warranty. If
                consumer is not satisfied with the services provided, he can file a complaint in the consumer
                commission.</p>

                different models, and consider the features that are important to you.</p>

    <h1>Necessary precautions to maintain functionality and safety</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Switch off the electrical points while not in use. This will not only give an economic saving, but also
                avoid unforeseen accidents. Remember that this is a national saving too.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Check all cords, plugs, surge protectors and extension board cords for frayed casing, exposed wire or
                broken components. Replace immediately.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Do not overload one outlet with several high-wattage or heat-producing devices, for example an iron,
                toaster, sandwich maker or tea/ coffee maker.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
